My name is Benjamin Chait-Walter, and I am a student in the BA/MA program. As an undergrad, I am studying economics, business, and math. As I start the master's part of the BA/MA program, I intend to concentrate in data analytics. I am most interested in probability and statistics and applying these ideas to better understand the world around me.
